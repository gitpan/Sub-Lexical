Sub/Lexical version 0.81
========================

Using this module will give your code the illusion of having lexically
scoped subroutines. This is because where ever a sub is lexically declared
it will really just turn into a my()ed scalar pointing to a coderef.

However the lexically scoped subs seem to work as one might expect them to.
They can see other lexically scoped variables and subs, and will fall out of
scope like they should. You can pass them around like coderefs, give them
attributes and prototypes too if you're feeling brave. Another advantage is
you can use them as truly private methods in packages, thereby realising
the dream of true encapsulation so many have dreamed of.
